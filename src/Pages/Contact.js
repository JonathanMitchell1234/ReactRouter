					React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces
					based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and
					companies.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with
					frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating
					React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side
					functionality.
